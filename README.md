Title: LineAnalyzer
Using object oriented programming, this C++ code provides a set of operations to perform calculations and checks on pairs of lines, including checking properties like equality, parallelism, perpendicularity, and intersection.

Main Functions:

    is_nonvertical(): Checks if the line is non-vertical (i.e., b1 != 0), and if so, calculates and prints the slope of the line.
    is_equal0(lineType line): Compares two lines and checks if they are equal based on a specific condition involving their coefficients.
    is_equal(lineType line): Checks if two lines are equal by comparing their coefficients directly or if they are scalar multiples of each other.
    is_parallel(lineType line): Determines if two lines are parallel by comparing their slopes.
    is_perpendicular(lineType line): Checks if two lines are perpendicular by calculating the product of their slopes and checking if it's equal to -1.
    is_intersection(lineType line): Calculates and prints the intersection point of two lines, if it exists.
