This C++ code implements a Tic Tac Toe game for two players using object oriented-programming:

    1. The board is a 3x3 grid, initialized with empty spaces.
    2. Players alternate placing 'X' and 'O' on the board.
    3. After each move, the game checks for a winner (3 consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal) or a draw (board full with no winner).
    4. The game continues until there is a winner or a draw, and invalid moves are prompted again.

The PlayGame function manages the game flow, including switching players and checking conditions after each move.
