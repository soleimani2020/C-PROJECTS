                              OTic tac toe.


1. we need a board game (3*3) -> define -> show  
2. we need two players ( switch player function ): 
   current player ---> next player
3. we need to know winning condition (check for winner):
    / Check Raws 
    / Check columns 
    / Check diagonals 

4. check if the game is a draw 
5. If the board has empty spots, then some one has one ! otherwise it is a draw
6. while (invalid move -> n,m >=3) , ask for the right move !
